### > log
  
  I've had a love for technology for as long as I can remember and have plenty of fond memories
  of taking apart any piece of tech I could get my hands on, just to see how they worked and how
  to put them back together!

### > recent-activity

  In recent months, I took a huge leap and joined a 17 week ‎developer course at Dev Academy.
  Coming into it, I never thought of myself as a "smart" person, so diving into something as
  intense as this‎ course was terrifying... But, I learned truly how hungry I was to learn and
  explorer new topics, especially something I'm passionate about like programming and tech!

#### [Unoriginal Block Game](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/unoriginal-block-game)

  At Dev Academy we were told that on week 7 they would be holding personal project presentations and
  that we should start thinking about what we might want to build to show off to everyone. At the same
  time I just so happened to have watched a video about how Minecrafts procedual generation worked.
  I had a talk to one of the facilitators at Dev Academy and they highly reccomened using 3js if I wanted
  to turn that dream into a reailty and after plenty of hard work I came up with this...
  
<img width="1909" height="980" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f6a04cc-4da6-4c23-80f0-f6e2e63d38a7" />

  A 3d generated block world where the user can walk around, climb hills, and even destroy blocks! One
  of the most important lessons and biggest mistakes while building this project was how little I commited...
  This was originally stored in a different repo but it got so messy that I had to rewrite everything from
  scratch and even then only 23 commits for a project this size isnt the best. So ever since then I've learnt
  my lessons and make sure to commit as frequently as I can!

#### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper-react)

  Before I came into Dev Academy, I wanted to get as prepared as I possibly could!
  So I started to mess around with some of the basics of HTML and JavaScript.

  One of the projects I was super proud of was a Minesweeper game which you can [play here!](https://lane-pearce-metcalfe.github.io/main-screen.html)
  However... after completing the course I wanted to see how much I've grown as a devloper as well
  as putting some of the new techonlgys like React to create a more dynamic and polished game.
  I'm still currently working on this React implementation but it's really cool to comapre [it's repo](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper-react) to
  the repo from the [previous minesweepers repo](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper) to see how much I've learnt in
  just a few months!

#### [Troll Toll Calculator](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/troll-bridge)
  Recently I've decided to revist one of the old projects we tried while in Dev Academy. During these
  projects we werent given a whole ton of time to complete them so to fresh up on my skills I wanted
  to come back and try again with a whole ton more skills under my built and the time to make all the
  improvments I wanted to that I just didn't have time to during Dev Academy! This also gives me a
  chance to take attention to detail and test myself to put out as high quality code as I possibly can
  esspecially without the pressure of deadlines or breaking the entire app minutes before we deploy.
