- [Minesweeper](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper-react)

  Before I came into Dev Academy, I wanted to get as prepared as I possibly could!
  So I started to mess around with some of the basics of HTML and JavaScript.

  One of the projects I was super proud of was a Minesweeper game which you can [play here!](https://lane-pearce-metcalfe.github.io/main-screen.html)
  However... after completing the course I wanted to see how much I've grown as a devloper as well
  as putting some of the new techonlgys like React to create a more dynamic and polished game.
  I'm still currently working on this React implementation but it's really cool to comapre [it's repo](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper-react) to
  the repo from the [previous minesweepers repo](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper) to see how much I've learnt in
  just a few months!
