#### [Unoriginal Block Game](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/unoriginal-block-game)

  At Dev Academy we were told that on week 7 they would be holding personal project presentations and
  that we should start thinking about what we might want to build to show off to everyone. At the same
  time I just so happened to have watched a video about how Minecrafts procedual generation worked.
  I had a talk to one of the facilitators at Dev Academy and they highly reccomened using 3js if I wanted
  to turn that dream into a reailty and after plenty of hard work I came up with this...

  A 3d generated block world where the user can walk around, climb hills, and even destroy blocks! One
  of the most important lessons and biggest mistakes while building this project was how little I commited...
  This was originally stored in a different repo but it got so messy that I had to rewrite everything from
  scratch and even then only 23 commits for a project this size isnt the best. So ever since then I've learnt
  my lessons and make sure to commit as frequently as I can!

#### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper-react)

  Before I came into Dev Academy, I wanted to get as prepared as I possibly could!
  So I started to mess around with some of the basics of HTML and JavaScript.

  One of the projects I was super proud of was a Minesweeper game which you can [play here!](https://lane-pearce-metcalfe.github.io/main-screen.html)
  However... after completing the course I wanted to see how much I've grown as a devloper as well
  as putting some of the new techonlgys like React to create a more dynamic and polished game.
  I'm still currently working on this React implementation but it's really cool to comapre [it's repo](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper-react) to
  the repo from the [previous minesweepers repo](https://github.com/lane-pearce-metcalfe/minesweeper) to see how much I've learnt in
  just a few months!
